- Compile with std=c++11.
- The algorithm prints the shortest path from one city to another in a directed, weighted graph.
- The output includes the route, the distance added by each city, and the total distance.
- The input includes three parts, as described below. An example input can be found in the input_example.txt file.  
  Please mind that if you supply input using a redirected input file, rather then copy paste input to terminal, then the lines 
  in the input file are expected to be terminated Linux style, and not Windows style.  
  The input structure is as follows:
```
number_of_cities
city 1
city 2
city 3

numbr_of_adjacencies
city name from, city name to, distance
city name from, city name to, distance
city name from, city name to, distance
city name from, city name to, distance
city name from, city name to, distance

query city from, query city to
```
