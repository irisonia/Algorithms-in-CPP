# Dijkstra README

- Compile with std=c++11.
- The algorithm prints the shortest path from a city to another, in a directed, weighted graph.
- The output include the rout, along with the distance added by each city, and the total distance.
- The input includes three parts, as described below. An example input can be found in the file Input_example.
